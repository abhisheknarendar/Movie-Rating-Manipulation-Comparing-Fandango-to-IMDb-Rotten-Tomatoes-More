Movie Rating Manipulation: Comparing Fandango to IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes & More

What This Project Is About

I read an article that said Fandango might be giving higher movie ratings than they should. So I decided to check if that's true by comparing Fandango’s ratings with other movie sites like IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, and Metacritic. I used Python and some popular data tools to do this analysis.

 What I Wanted to Find Out

- Is Fandango giving higher ratings than other websites?
- Are the ratings honest or are they being changed to look better?
- What do the numbers show when we compare them?

Tools I Used

- Python  
- Pandas – to handle and clean the data  
- NumPy – for doing math operations  
- Matplotlib and Seaborn – to make charts and graphs  
- Jupyter Notebook – to write and run the code

The Data

The data came from a FiveThirtyEight article. It includes:
- Fandango movie ratings
- Ratings from IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, and Metacritic
- Movies mostly from around 2015

What I Did

- Compared Fandango’s ratings with ratings from the other platforms
- Checked if Fandango was rounding up more often
- Focused on popular movies (those with more than 30 user ratings)
- Created graphs to help show the differences

What I Found

- Fandango ratings were often higher than ratings from other sites
- There is a clear pattern of rounding up or inflating scores
- Other platforms like IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes had more balanced and fair ratings

My Conclusion

The analysis supports the idea that Fandango’s ratings were made to look better than they really are. This shows how data analysis can help find the truth behind online content.
